# Cuyagua by Zunair, Yusra and Pam. 

- Project Name: Cuyagua

- Project Description:

The purpose of this project is to keep a place alive and accessible through the possibilities of the web. This is an interactive web that provides a journey to Cuyagua through an auditory experience. In the main page you will find the visual map with different stations (points/numbers) with which you can interact and learn more about this hidden place in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. It is a mix of both languages, English and Spanish since the people who narrate the experience are mostly spanish-speaking (all except me, the translator). While the main audience might seem to be English speaking people (and that is why we have provided an English script),  we tried to the best of our abilities to provide access to spanish- speaking people by translating some parts of the page, such as the about page. If we have had more time, perhaps we could have translated the whole web so spanish speaking people could also fill out the contact form!
 
- Process:

Pam: This page is in honor to the people of Cuyagua; to the place that gave me the greatest  memories of my childhood;  to the place that made me fall in love with nature, drums and my own Afro Venezuelan cultural heritage.  I had footage from this place that my sister and I recorded in 2014 so in addition to a couple of questions that I asked to several family members I developed the script of a journey that divided itself in 6 parts: the road, the town, the house, the food, the beach and the reality (on our way back). I focused mostly on sound design. I used original footage such as the interviews of Pablo, Paola, Paul, Adriana, Alberto Papo’s voice as well as my own voice as the translator and dozens (if not hundreds) of sounds taken from freesound.org and youtube. (We are thankful for their existence). It was a long process to gather all the sounds and to organize them in a sequential way. 
Yusra and Zunair: we worked collectively so the webpage complemented the sound story. We used photoshop to edit the backgrounds, illustrators to design the map and javascript to implement interactivities  such as the appearance of the title on the web, the movement of the pins in the map and the appearance of the script. The design thinking process included finding a font that described that adventurous yet mysterious element of the place as well as visual elements that allowed the map, the script and the representation of sound (the wavelength) to exist in the same space. We also made it responsive to smart devices!!
 
- Reflection/Evaluation: 

We are happy about the product and the process of a collective effort that involves constant communication and respect for each other’s decisions while dividing our tasks. I am personally grateful to have worked with such a hard working team given the huge time constraint. 

(Pam) This project was a dream for me and now it’s materialized. Cuyagua will always be on the web, close to me… until I can come back. Thank you guys!

Something I could have improved is the discrepancy between the words translated and the written script itself in the first two tracks. By the time we got the feedback I had already all of the translation recordings and I decided to proceed and finish the remaining 4 tracks which have an improved mixing between the translation and the interviewed voices. I could have changed the script but in respect of other people’s words I decided to keep it as close as I could from the original message. (You can always choose not to read if it gets confusing!! haha).
